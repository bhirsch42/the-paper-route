		<h1>The Art of Invitation</h1>
		<h3>
			The written word retains a certain charm. When an important event comes along, it should be heralded by something special.  There are better ways to bookend your next big gathering than an email full of details and a thank-you text. News delivered in a bright envelope stands apart, and can only contain good news.
